Reference implementations for length of stay labeling using both PyHealth and MIMIC-IV Data Pipeline.

run_pyhealth.py can be run directly for PyHealth.

run_pipeline.py is more complex. You have to copy this program into your MIMIC-IV Data Pipeline folder (installed following https://github.com/healthylaife/MIMIC-IV-Data-Pipeline), and then run it from within that folder.
